# Profound header
This is the repo that contains all the blog posts. In a
(maybe) distant future, if you want to contribute a post,
you should be able to just create a PR. However, for now
it is just for personal use.

# Blog repo
The development of the blog itself is done
[here](https://github.com/ZenTauro/web-blog)
