In this series I will detail how to build a blog with
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/ "Gatsby's official website").
I'll go into the details of setting up the enviroment, the APIs
to use when generating pages and the mental idea to keep when
creating the resources needed to build the page.

I'll also reference code snippets taken from this site (those
are under the license specified in the
[repo](https://github.com/ZenTauro/web-blog))
